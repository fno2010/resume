Research Interests
------------------

*   Networking resources abstraction and optimization
*   Software-defined networking
*   Networks for large-scale data analytics


Project Experience
------------------

*   **OpenDaylight ALTO**

    *Project Contact*, 2015 - present

	*   Official open source implementation of the Application-Layer Traffic
        Optimization (ALTO) protocol.
	-   Designed and Implemented the main building blocks of ALTO in OpenDaylight.
    -   Manage the project in the OpenDaylight community and review the code.
    *   Created OpenALTO community (<https://github.com/openalto/>).

*   **Unicorn: Unified Resource Orchestration for Multi-Domain, Geo-Distributed Data Analytics**

    *Architect and Contact*, August - November 2017

	*   The first multi-domain, multi-controller orchestration system for
        scientific data analytics.
	*   Coordinated with the collaborators from CERN, Caltech and Starlight to
        deploy the system in Caltech HEP Data Center.
    -   Demonstrated the prototype in SuperComputing 2017.

*   **Devopen: SDN IDE**

    *Project Lead*, 2016 - 2017

	-   The first IDE supporting visual programming for Software-Defined Networking.
    -   Integrate the complete SDN lifecycle of Dev, Op and Use.
	-   Gaven the tutorial and demonstration in OpenDaylight Summit 2016 and
        SuperComputing 2016.

*   **SeL4-based HD-ElastOS** (Kortide, Shanghai)

    *Intern*, Octobor 2014 - April 2015

    -   A Component Assembly Runtime (CAR) embedded operating system on top of
        state-of-the-art micro kernel.
    *   Ported micro-kernel seL4 to some specific hardware platforms (pandanboard,
        lamobo M1, etc.).
    *   Ported ElastOS on top of seL4.
